# PRODIGY_WD_03
This code implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure includes a 3x3 grid for the game board, a reset button, and a message area to display the game status. CSS styles center the game on the page and enhance the visual appeal of the cells. The JavaScript logic manages the game flow: it tracks the current player, the state of each cell, and checks for winning conditions or a draw after each move. Event listeners are set up for cell clicks and the reset button, allowing players to make moves and restart the game. The game alternates between players 'X' and 'O' and provides feedback on the game's outcome, making it interactive and user-friendly.
